        <h2 class="text-center"> Building a Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web App with Flask and Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>In the age of technology and information, access to accurate and timely healthcare is more critical than ever. With the increasing importance of remote healthcare solutions, we embarked on a journey to develop a symptom-based disease diagnosis web application. Leveraging Flask for the backend and a Decision Tree Classifier model, we created a user-friendly platform that can help users identify potential illnesses based on their reported symptoms.</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>The project began with recognizing a common issue: people often experience symptoms and want quick answers about their health concerns. It can be challenging to differentiate between various diseases, especially when symptoms overlap. Our goal was to provide a convenient solution for users to input their symptoms and receive potential diagnoses.</p>

        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>We developed a web app that allows users to enter a list of symptoms they are experiencing. The app then uses a pre-trained Decision Tree Classifier model to predict the most likely disease based on the provided symptoms. Here's how it works:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><b><strong>Symptom Input:</strong></b> Users enter their symptoms through a user-friendly interface. The web app supports a wide range of symptoms, making it versatile for different scenarios.</li>
            <li><b><strong>Machine Learning Model:</strong></b> We trained a Decision Tree Classifier using a dataset containing symptoms and corresponding diseases. The model is capable of predicting diseases based on input symptoms.</li>
            <li><b><strong>Prediction:</strong></b> The app uses the model to predict the most likely disease, providing users with instant information about potential health concerns.</li>
            <li><b><strong>Additional Information: </strong></b> To enhance user experience, the app also provides additional information about the predicted disease. This includes a description of the disease, recommended precautions, medications, dietary advice, and workout tips.</li>

        </ol>
